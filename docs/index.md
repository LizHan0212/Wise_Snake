# WiseSnake

WiseSnake is an AI trained to play an enhanced version of the classic Snake game with randomized barriers and multiple fruit types. It utilizes reinforcement learning methods such as Tabular Q-Learning and Deep Q Networks to learn optimal strategies as it interacts with the environment. Though the model isn't explicitly programmed with the game's rules, it learns through trial and error via a score system, being rewarded for actions such as collecting fruit and penalized for things like collisions.
